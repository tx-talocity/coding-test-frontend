# coding-test-frontend
Welcome to the coding test for frontend / full stack developer role

# How to do the test
- Create a new github repository where you will store your code
- It would be great if you commit code as you make progress. This will show us your approach to the coding.
- Please share any instructions that you need us to follow to run the code

# Requirements
- You are going to call a REST API that will shorten a URL. The API documentation is given at following URL `https://github.com/robvanbakel/gotiny-api#create-gotiny-link`
- Create a page that has an text box where user will enter the URL that has to be shortened
- Call the REST API that will shorten the URL
- Display the shortened URL on the page
  - Example: http://gotiny.cc/skkfp6
- You should handle the situation where the API gives an error or is not reachable (i.e. you don't get a response) or does not exist
  - You can test wrong URL case by changing the REST API url to a wrong URL and you will not get a response)
  - You should also handle the case if the user gives a bad input URL to shorten
- Think of other test cases and handle them also
- The page should work in both web and on mobile
